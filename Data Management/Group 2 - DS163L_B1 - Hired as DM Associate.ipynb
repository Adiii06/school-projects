    "\n",
    "In a startup company where data knowledge is just starting and there is no standard regarding data encoding, you've been hired as a Data Management Associate. As a new hire, you've been tasked with creating a function to verify the input data from an Excel file that a data encoder manually populates. This excel file contains Name, Age, Date of Birth, Social Security Number, Tax Identification Number and Drivers License. `DID YOU KNOW?` ***Even the most forgiving statistics in data entry work reveal an average human error rate of 1%. In the context of sales operations, that means that if your CSR is tasked with processing 1000 orders,  you can expect 10 to be incorrect*** - [Conexiom](https://conexiom.com/blog/understanding-impact-100-percent-order-accuracy/#:~:text=Even%20the%20most%20forgiving%20statistics,expect%2010%20to%20be%20incorrect). With this information you drafted the format and data governance conditions to make sure that the input from the excel file is correct before it is ingested to your new database. Below are the specifications:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Name (Condition: No special characters | ,.!@#$%^&*() are not allowed)\n",
    "- Age (Must be a valid Age)\n",
    "- Date_of_Birth (Format: DD/MM/YY)\n",
    "- Social_Security_Number (Format: XX-XXXXXXX-X)\n",
    "- Tax_Identification_Number (Format: XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX)\n",
    "- Drivers_License (Format: CXX-XX-XXXXXX)\n",
    "\n",
    "X = digit <br>\n",
    "C = character\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Python function called `validate_inputs_df` to verify the input DataFrame and another function called `insert_df_to_db` to save its contents to an SQLite database if it conforms to your drafted specifications. For verification, there are 25 accounts for initial account open and only 20 of those conforms to your standards. GOOD LUCK!"

    "The ***insert_df_to_db*** function now uses a ***try-except*** block to catch potential ***sqlite3.Error*** exceptions that might occur during the database insertion process. This ensures that the code doesn't crash if there's an issue with the database connection, table creation, or data insertion itself. Moreover, inside the ***except*** block, the code prints a more informative message that includes the row index and the specific error message from the database (***e***). This helps identify the exact row that caused the issue and the nature of the problem. Overall, this revised code prevents unexpected crashes and allows for debugging and corrective actions when data insertion fails. By gracefully handling errors, we can ensure data integrity and maintain a smooth data ingestion process."
